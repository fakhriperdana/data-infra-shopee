- Kubernetes is a container orchestration tools that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Developers write the targeted/desired state in a configuration files including the specification of the instance, resources, etc. Kubernetes make sure the targeted/desired states fulfilled by checking the pods state and creating, deleting, scaling those pods as needed. We use Kubernetes when we want to easily scale our applications seamlessly adjusting to the application needs and we use Kubernetes for reliability, if we want to ensure our application stays up and running smoothly even when some parts of it fails.

- We can control behaviour of the developer/engineer team in our system by utilizing access management such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Access Control Lists (ACL). By that we can limit the permissions in which how many resources can be accessed by a certain role of developer. This can make a more secure environment for the engineering team as a whole by making sure higher ups can be more responsible in the more critical sections of the system and giving junior engineers more secluded and limited environment for them to experiment and make "mistakes"
